# Cloudflare Auth Worker

A TypeScript-based lightweight authentication service optimized for Cloudflare Workers, built with:

- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Postgres with Neon](https://neon.tech)

This setup offers the following benefits:

- Efficient development through integration of Cloudflare CLI, Better Auth CLI, and Drizzle CLI.
- Seamless transition between development and production environments.
- Apply changes consistently using a script.

You can extend this setup with custom scripts tailored to your workflow. Thatâ€™s how I use it as well.

## Environment Variables

This service uses three types of environment variable files for CLI tools, local development, and production deployment.

### .env

Used locally by CLI tools such as:

- Drizzle CLI
- Better Auth CLI

```dotenv
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8801
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<YOUR_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET>
DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
```

### .dev.vars

Used by Wrangler in local development.

```bash
pnpm run dev  # Runs `wrangler dev`, loading variables from .dev.vars
```

```dotenv
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8801
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<YOUR_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET>
DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
```

### .dev.vars.production

Used during deployment to register secrets on Cloudflare.

```bash
pnpm run deploy  # Runs `wrangler secret bulk .dev.vars.production && wrangler deploy --minify`
```

```dotenv
BETTER_AUTH_URL=<YOUR_WORKER_URL>
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<YOUR_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET>
DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_DATABASE_URL>
```
